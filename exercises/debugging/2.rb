# Examples

unicornfish = Fish.new(:herbivore, 'breathe underwater')
penguin = FlightlessBird.new(:carnivore, 'drink sea water')
robin = SongBird.new(:omnivore, 'sing', 'chirp chirrr chirp chirp chirrrr')

# FlightlessBird's #initialize method is not necessary since
# it simply calls the parent class's #initialize method and
# passes all paremeters to it. The parent's #initialize method
# would be inherited without doing this explicitly.
