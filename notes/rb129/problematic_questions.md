q3 - very long question, could practice structuring reply, split it into multiple questions?

q4 - again just a long and awkward question to answer

q7 - Found this awkward

q12 - A kind of scattered, unclear grouping of example/question. Is the idea here that the Array is technically a collaborator but we should focus on the objects of custom classes that are stored in the array? Took me just under 11 mins and a lot of it was just describing an overly elaborate example that doesn't seem to demonstrate anything very clear about the LS material. Not sure it's worth bothering with this one again

q12 - took a long time to answer

q14 - took a long time to answer

q16 - Took a long time to answer

q19 - Took a long time to answer

q22 - Took a **very** long time to answer

q26 - Took a long time to answer

q30 -Took a long time to answer, probably because it asks for examples of when we would use method of all three types of access level, maybe should break up

q32- This is the question that someone said would take half an hour to answer, could try breaking it into three

q33 - General question on encapsulation. Need to practice this repeatedly, especially an example, since its such a general principle it's hard to even give a satisfying example.

q34 - took a long time to answer, very awkward, is it even asking for an explanation of how the classes work? Is the answer to the question just that `Person` and `Cat` don't have a logical superclass of which they are specialized types?

q35 - What is OOP? Remember that OOP is partly about allowing us to think at a greater level of abstraction

q36 - got confused, didn't know how to answer, I think this is actually a more basic question than I think, judging from the question-links document's link on this. It's literally just a single bullet point in the Summary for lesson 2.
