3. very long question, could practice structuring reply
4. again just a long and awkward question to answer
5. Found this awkward
6. A kind of scattered, unclear grouping of example/question. Is the idea here that the Array is technically a collaborator but we should focus on the objects of custom classes that are stored in the array? Took me just under 11 mins and a lot of it was just describing an overly elaborate example that doesn't seem to demonstrate anything very clear about the LS material. Not sure it's worth bothering with this one again
7. took a long time to answer
8. took a long time to answer
9. Took a long time to answer
10. Took a long time to answer
11. Took a **very** long time to answer
12. Took a long time to answer
13. Took a long time to answer, probably because it asks for examples of when we would use method of all three types of access level
14. Took a long time to answer

16. Took a long time to answer

19. Took a long time to answer

22. Took a long time to answer

26. Took a long time to answer

30. 

32. This is the question that someone said would take half an hour to answer, could try breaking it into three

33. General question on encapsulation. Need to practice this repeatedly, especially an example, since its such a general principle it's hard to even give a satisfying example.
