q3 - I do not see a way to describe 'why' what is output in detail, and answer the two questions on top of it in much less than 15 minutes. The code is just too complicated and the constant resolution question just requires so much detail in response (including stuff about namespaced constant resolution that is not mentioned in the material)

q4 - again just a long and awkward question to answer. Can be done in around 10 minutes. Would be difficult to do in much less.

q12 - Definitely don't bother with this again

q12 - took a long time to answer

q14 - took a long time to answer

q16 - Took a long time to answer

q19 - Took a long time to answer

q22 - Took a **very** long time to answer

q26 - Took a long time to answer

q30 -Took a long time to answer, probably because it asks for examples of when we would use method of all three types of access level, maybe should break up

q32- This is the question that someone said would take half an hour to answer, could try breaking it into three

q33 - General question on encapsulation. Need to practice this repeatedly, especially an example, since its such a general principle it's hard to even give a satisfying example.

q34 - took a long time to answer, very awkward, is it even asking for an explanation of how the classes work? Is the answer to the question just that `Person` and `Cat` don't have a logical superclass of which they are specialized types?

q35 - What is OOP? Remember that OOP is partly about allowing us to think at a greater level of abstraction

q36 - got confused, didn't know how to answer, I think this is actually a more basic question than I think, judging from the question-links document's link on this. It's literally just a single bullet point in the Summary for lesson 2.

q43 - took a long time

q47 - took a long time, probably a bad question tbh as it just takes a long time to describe all these classes. Maybe change to a less detailed approach?

q50 - took a very long time, not sure it's realistic to answer this question in under 10 minutes given how many types of variable and their scopes (and a quirky exception !) are involved.
