**What is OOP and why is it important?**

 Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm intended to solve the problems of building and maintaining large, complex software projects. OOP provides facilities for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in order to reduce code dependencies, avoid the problems of global state, and improve the scalability and maintainability of code

As non-OOP programs grow in scale and complexity, there can be a tendency for a program to become a mass of dependencies, with every part of the code base dependent on many other parts. This can make programs difficult to maintain, since any change or addition to one part could cause a ripple of adverse effects throughout

OOP attempts to solve these problems by providing ways to section off areas of code, creating containers for data and functionality that can be changed without affecting every other part of the code base. A program becomes the orchestrated interaction of small parts rather than a mass of dependency.

By abstracting away implementation details behind interfaces, OOP allows the programmer to think at a higher level of abstraction in terms of the 'nouns' of the problem domain, in terms of real world objects. OOP designs can thus help conceptually to break down and solve complex problems

OOP features such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance, can also facilitate code reuse in a greater variety of contexts



* Reduces code dependencies

* Avoids problems of global state

* Allows programmer to think at a higher level of abstraction, in terms of nouns modeling entities at the problem domain level, to think in terms of real world objects. This helps break down complex problems

* Allows for flexible extension of existing code and the reuse of code in different contexts
