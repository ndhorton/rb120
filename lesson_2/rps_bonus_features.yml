    Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an extended version of the\n
    classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Two players each choose moves\n
    from five possibilities -- Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock --\n
    and the following rules determine the winner:\n\n
    \t* Rock:\t\tblunts Scissors, and crushes Lizard\n
    \t* Paper:\twraps Rock, and disproves Spock\n
    \t* Scissors:\tcuts Paper, and decapitates Lizard\n
    \t* Lizard:\teats Paper, and poisons Spock\n
    \t* Spock:\tvaporizes Rock, and smashes Scissors\n\n
    If both players make the same move, the round is tied.\n\n
    Before playing, you will be asked to pick a winning number of points\n
    between 1 and 10. For each round, the winning player scores a point;\n
    if the hand is tied, neither player scores a point. The winner of\n
    the game is the first player to reach the designated winning number\n
    of points.\n\n
    After you have chosen the number of winning points, you can view\n
    these rules again by entering 'help' at any prompt. You can also\n
    view the log of past moves by entering 'history' at any prompt.",
