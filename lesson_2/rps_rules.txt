Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an extended version of the
classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Two players each choose moves 
from five possibilities -- Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock --
and the following rules determine the winner:

    * Rock:     blunts Scissors, and crushes Lizard
    * Paper:    wraps Rock, and disproves Spock
    * Scissors: cuts Paper, and decapitates Lizard
    * Lizard:   eats Paper, and poisons Spock
    * Spock:    vaporizes Rock, and smashes Scissors

If both players make the same move, the round is tied.

Before playing, you will be asked to pick a winning number of
points. For each round, the winning player scores a point; if
the hand is tied, neither player scores a point. The winner
of the game is the first player to reach the designated
winning number of points.
