    # Rules
    rules: "
    Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is an extended version of the\n
    classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Two players each choose moves\n
    from five possibilities -- Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock --\n
    and the following rules determine the winner:\n\n
    \t* Rock:\tblunts Scissors, and crushes Lizard\n
    \t* Paper:\twraps Rock, and disproves Spock\n
    \t* Scissors:\tcuts Paper, and decapitates Lizard\n
    \t* Lizard:\teats Paper, and poisons Spock\n
    \t* Spock:\tvaporizes Rock, and smashes Scissors\n\n
    If both players make the same move, the round is tied.\n\n
    Before playing, you will be asked to pick a winning number of\n
    points. For each round, the winning player scores a point; if\n
    the hand is tied, neither player scores a point. The winner\n
    of the game is the first player to reach the designated\n
    winning number of points.",
