Twenty-One is a card game for two players, a human player and a computer dealer.
Both players are dealt two cards and the human player goes first. The player can
see both of their own cards but only one of the dealer's cards. After looking
at the cards, the player has the chance to hit or stick. The goal is to get a
hand worth 21 points. If a player hits and their hand is now worth more than 21,
they are considered bust and the dealer wins. The same applies to the dealer.
The player can choose to hit as many times as they like until they are bust.
Once the player decides to stick, it is the dealer's turn.

The dealer will choose to hit until his hand is worth at least 17. Then, if
the dealer is not bust, the dealer sticks.

The winner is declared to be the player whose hand is closest to 21.

The deck has 4 suits * 13 cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king,
ace). The number cards are worth their face number. The royal cards are worth
10. The ace is worth 1 or 11 depending on which is more beneficial. If an
ace being worth 11 causes the player to go bust, then the ace is worth 1.
Otherwise, the ace is worth 11.

If the hands are equal, the players are tied?
It isn't clear whether to permit the user to continue to hit if they have 21.

participants try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Here is an overview of the game:
- Both paritcipants are initilaly dealt 2 cards from a 52-card deck.
- The player takes the first turn, and can "hit" or "stay".
- If the player busts, he loses. If he stays, it's the dealer's turn.
- The dealer must hit until his cards addd up to at least 17.
- If he busts, the player wins. If both player and dealer stay, then the
    highest total wins.
- If both totals are equal, then it's a tie, and nobody wins.
